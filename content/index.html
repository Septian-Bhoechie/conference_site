<h3>The Grid</h3>
<h4 class="subheader">The Grid lets you quickly put together page layouts for mobile devices and the desktop. You don't need two different sites - the Grid is built to create a rock-solid experience on all kinds of devices with the exact same markup.</h4>
<hr />
<h4>The Basics</h4>
<p>The grid is built around three key elements: containers, rows, and columns. Containers create base padding for the page; rows create a max-width and contain the columns; and columns create the final structure. Everything on your page that you don't give a specific structural style to should be within a container, row and column.</p>
